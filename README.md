# pl-sem-seg
Repository for implementation and training of semantic segmentation models using PyTorch Lightning

## Dataset Used
The [KITTI semantic segmentation dataset](http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/eval_semseg.php?benchmark=semantics2015) is used in this. So, it needs to be downloaded from above link. It is used for it's small size (200 semantically annotated images and 200 test images).

More details will be added soon.
